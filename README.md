# UniGuru Behavior & Safety Sprint — Implementation

Files created:
- `behavioral_rules.py`: Declarative specification of intent classification, response constraints, and decision-routing rules. No execution paths are present.
- `test_behavioral_rules.py`: Constraint verification tests ensuring required behaviors are allowed or blocked per scenario. No response generation or runtime behavior.
- `DEMO_SCRIPT.md`: Verbatim mandatory live demo script with expected system behavior (specification only).

Execution model:
- This submission is non-executable by design.
- No demo runner, CLI, or interactive flow is included.
- All artifacts define constraints, invariants, and allowed behavior only.

Notes:
- The system does not perform actions, generate responses, or imply control.
- Demo scenarios are documented as expected behavior mappings, not runnable flows.
- Tests validate rule consistency and boundary enforcement only.
